A simple Arcanoid game

The game consists in knocking down blocks using a ball bounced with a paddle located at the bottom of the screen. To win you must knock down all the blocks.
After breaking some blocks, bonuses may fall out in the form of additional balls, increasing the speed of their flight or the platform itself

The application will continue to be developed over time
